## About
This project focuses on decentralized document storage, utilizing IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for file storage and smart contracts on a blockchain network (using Solidity) to store the hash values of documents. By leveraging IPFS and blockchain technology, the project ensures secure, tamper-proof, and decentralized storage of documents.

## Features
- Utilizes IPFS for decentralized and secure file storage.
- Smart contracts written in Solidity for storing document hash values on the blockchain.
- Integrates Next.js for front-end development.
- Utilizes Web3Storage for interacting with IPFS.
- Uses Volta testnet blockchain network for testing purposes.
- Incorporates Ether.js for smooth interaction with smart contracts.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the application using `npm run dev`.
5. Access the application through your web browser.
6. Begin uploading documents to be securely stored on IPFS and the blockchain.
